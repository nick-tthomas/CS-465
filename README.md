Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web app framework used as the back end server for this project. HTML was used for creating the structures of the web pages. JavaScript is an extremely versatile language that was used to add dynamic behavior to the web app. SPAs are web apps that interact with the user by dynamically rewriting the current page. This provided a smoother and more responsive UX by loading content without full page reloads. MongoDB is a NoSQL document-oriented databased that stores data in JSON-like BSON. This worked well for our application since we didn't want a traditional relational database structure. The combination of each of these technologies enables the development of a modern, responsive, and scalable full stack app that I'm personally very proud of.
